* Sync documentation with tracy.h and recent developments
* Add TRACY_DETACH_CHILD to signal hook. But that needs some more thought - we
  need to pass the signal to the child if we are going to detach, etc.
* Look at src/BROKEN_WITH_ABI and fix appropriately.
* Decide whether TRACY_HOOK_ABORT should kill all processes regardless if we
  started them or attached to them, or that it should detach ones that we
  attached to and kill the rest, etc...
* Add support for musl (mostly done, requires a small change to lseek and ifdef
  statements around the backtrace/execinfo.h)

* Add support for loading relocatable code in the binary. Some kind of modules?
  Would be awesome. Load dl in the process?
* Add python module (compiled from C, not ctypes; maybe a high level wrapper
around the C module, but no ctypes). For python API.

* Add support for injection/modification with a different ABI than current.
