Known bugs:

 * Python bindings are currently broken because of the ABI change
 * ABI detection on amd64 is not race safe. This should not be a problem
   for almost anyone, except when they're writing secure jails.

 * No BSD support yet. I will try a FreeBSD port sometime soon.
 * No support for MIPS, PPC64, ARM64
 * No 'proper' tests
